Orwex Protocol
A minimalist decentralized lending protocol enabling WETH-collateralized USDC borrowing with Chainlink oracle integration and automated liquidation mechanisms.

#Protocol Summary
Problem Domain
Decentralized lending protocols require robust collateralization mechanisms, real-time price feeds, and automated liquidation systems to maintain solvency. Orwex addresses this through a simplified single-collateral, single-borrow architecture.
